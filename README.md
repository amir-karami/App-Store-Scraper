# App Store Scraper

A basic parser for an app store page using BeautifulSoup.

A basic crawler for searching categories on the app store.

## Getting Started

Install Python (built using 3.6).

Create a virtualenv.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use

You'll need to create a database to communicate with. (This isn't absolutely necessary but if you don't, you'll have to re-implement a few things)

I've created some simple sql create statements to get the basic tables. This uses sqlite.
